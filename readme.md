# Web AR Demo

Using Ar.js to create a simple web AR experience.

We create a custom RTÉ pattern file and designed a poster prompting users to open their smart phones and navigate to ar.rte.ie and point the camera at the poster.

An animated character should then pop out from the poster. 

The character has a message asking the user to tap him.

On tap the character does a spin and music plays

This is a very basic concept used to illustrate the potential of Web AR. 

The posters were professionally printed and posted up around RTÉ.
